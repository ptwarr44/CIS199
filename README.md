# CIS199
Contains all programs from CIS199 at UofL - C# Programming

### Program 1
    // This program takes in three inputs for a paint job and gives the numbers needed to complete the paint job,
    // including the total cost
    
### Program 2
    // This program takes the first letter of the students last name along with the 
    // radio button associated with their grade level and tells the student when they
    // are able to register
    
### Program 3
    // This solution keeps the first letter of the last name as a char
    // and uses if/else logic for the times.
    // It uses defined strings for the dates and times to make it easier
    // to maintain.
    // It only uses programming elements introduced in the text or
    // in class.
    // This solution takes advantage of the fact that there really are
    // only two different time patterns used. One for juniors and seniors
    // and one for sophomores and freshmen. The pattern for sophomores
    // and freshmen is complicated by the fact the certain letter ranges
    // get one date and other letter ranges get another date.

### Program 4
    // This program lets the user input all values of a ground package, including dimensions and zip codes.
    // The user can then add these packages to the list box
    // Once in the list, user has the ability to view specific details and change the "To" and "From" portions 
    // of the selected package.
